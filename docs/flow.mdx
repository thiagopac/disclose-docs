Flow helpers let you compose multiple items in time.

## Helpers

- `sequence(a, b, c)` plays items back-to-back
- `parallel(a, b, c)` plays items together
- `on(start, ...items)` schedules items at a specific time
- `when(predicate, ...items)` runs items conditionally

## Example

```ts
import { Scene, Circle, Rect, sequence, on } from 'disclose-dsl';

const scene = Scene(() => [
  sequence(
    Circle(48).fill('#f97316').scale({ from: 0, to: 1, duration: 600 }),
    Rect(140, 80).fill('#0ea5e9').rotate({ from: 0, to: Math.PI / 8, duration: 600 })
  ),
  on('scene+1200', Circle(10).fill('#22c55e').move({ y: [-80, 80], duration: 900, loop: true })),
]);
```
