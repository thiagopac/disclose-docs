title: Disclose DSL

Disclose DSL is a declarative motion language for composing scenes, shapes, and timelines. It’s built to make motion design feel like assembling building blocks: you describe what should exist, and the engine handles drawing, timing, and orchestration.

**Positioning**
- **Solves:** Rapid motion prototyping without a full animation toolchain; consistent, reusable motion; programmable scenes that stay readable.
- **Is:** A compact 2D motion DSL with a canvas renderer and a timeline-driven runtime; framework-agnostic.
- **Is not:** A visual timeline editor, a 3D engine, or a full physics simulator.

**Highlights**
- Compose scenes with a single `Scene` function
- Build geometry from primitives (circle, rect, path, polygon, text)
- Chain universal modifiers (`fill`, `stroke`, `move`, `scale`, `rotate`, `opacity`)
- Orchestrate time with `sequence`, `parallel`, `on`, and `when`
- Inspect errors and warnings through `Diagnostics`

**Quick Start**

```ts
import { Scene, Circle, play } from 'disclose-dsl';

const scene = Scene(() => [
  Circle(60).fill('#0ea5e9').move({ x: [-200, 200], duration: 1600, loop: true }),
]);

const canvas = document.querySelector('#stage');
if (canvas) play(canvas, scene);
```
