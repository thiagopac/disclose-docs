Disclose DSL is an experimental, declarative motion language for composing scenes, shapes, and timelines. The API is fluent and compact, so you can build motion quickly without boilerplate.

**Highlights**
- Compose scenes with a single `Scene` function
- Build geometry from primitives (circle, rect, path, polygon, text)
- Chain universal modifiers (`fill`, `stroke`, `move`, `scale`, `rotate`, `opacity`)
- Orchestrate time with `sequence`, `parallel`, `on`, and `when`

Start here:
- [Getting Started](./get-started)
- [Shapes](./shapes)
- [Modifiers](./modifiers)
- [Time & Flow](./time)
